# HAA
 Fast Approximate anti aliasing solution for Unity. Mainly created as an experiment.
 
# Usage
  Just add the HAA component to a camera
  
# Settings
  
  Strength: Strength of the softening applied to the edges.
  
  Threshold: Threshold of edge detection. 
  
  Sharpen: Optional sharpening to the edges.
  
# Compatibility
  
  This anti aliasing uses Compute Shaders (yeah, blame me for that) so it probably wont work on mobiles. I have only tested it on my PC with DirectX 11.
